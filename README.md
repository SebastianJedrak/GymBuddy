# GymBuddy

GymBuddy is a project that was created out of my passion for the gym. During my adventure with the gym, I acquired a lot of knowledge about training. 
For this reason, many of my friends have turned to me for help with their training. This is how the idea for an application was born. The application will guide the user's training in a simple and quick way.

The goal of the application was to combine simplicity of use with a variety of exercises and solid training plans. 

# Getting started

To use my program locally you will need an API key. You can get one for free from https://api-ninjas.com/

# Usage

<b>The use of the application is very simple.</b>

You specify the parameters of the training you want to perform. You can choose which body part you want to focus on, decide on the type of training and its length. A built-in tutorial will walk you through the details of each option.

<b>Once the exercises are generated, you can start your training.</b>

The set of each exercise is displayed individually with information about the number of repetitions and the weight to lift. Once done, you'll move on to the next set. If the set was too heavy or too light for you, you can modify your next set or skip the current exercise altogether. You can also open a help window if you don't know how to perform an exercise.

After you have completed all the exercises, a dialog box will open with a summary of your training. <b>Congratulations :)</b>
